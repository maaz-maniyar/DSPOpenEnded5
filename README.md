Analyze the PPG signal to compute heart rate and SpO2: Read the PPG signal provided “PPG”. The given samples of PPG signal contains RED and IR data which are obtained with a sampling rate of 15 Hz. Compute the DFT of both RED and IR and plot the magnitude of DFT v/s frequency. Calculate the heart rate and SpO2 for the given PPG signal. Also, compare and contrast on the results obtained using ECG signal.
